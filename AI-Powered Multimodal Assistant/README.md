## Features

### Quantized Model Integration

This application uses "quantized models," which are optimized for performance on standard consumer hardware. While traditional AI models demand powerful machines, these quantized versions deliver efficient performance without compromising accuracy. This ensures that the chatbot runs seamlessly on everyday computers. (Powered by TheBloke Quantized Models)

### Audio Chatting with Whisper AI

### Image Chatting with LLaVA

The chatbot integrates LLaVA, a fine-tuned LLaMA model, for understanding and interacting with images. Using CLIP-generated image embeddings, LLaVA provides advanced text-image comprehension, creating an engaging and dynamic chat experience around visual content. (Powered by llama-cpp-python)

### PDF Chatting with Chroma DB

Designed for professional and academic use, this feature utilizes Chroma DB as a vector database for efficient PDF interactions. Users can upload and interact with PDFs to extract summaries, insights, or engage in a dialogue with the content. Whether it's a business report or an academic paper, the chatbot offers an intuitive and powerful way to interact with PDF data. (Powered by Chroma)
